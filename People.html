        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p> am a first-year student in Bachelor of IT. I’m somewhat interested in IT and have found it to be the most enjoyable course that I’ve been studying. I hope to be able to develop websites as a starting point and then dive further into developing more technical software and programs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>Communication is something that I find myself good at when it comes to group work. Currently I don’t have many strong points in the field of IT yet. Something that interests me is how technology continues to advance at a constant rate and hopefully someday I would like to be a part of that change.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My role for this project is a front-end developer. I think this is an important job, and our software is inseparable from front-end related work in the process of testing and development.
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am a first-year student in Bachelor of IT. I have always had an interest in the field of IT and which really began to grow during my high school years in which I took multiple courses in IT. As it begins to become more integrated into the lives of the general public I want to be at the head of that change. To help make the life of the average person easier.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>I find my strength in it to mainly be focused around the field of programming and writing code and html it's the area of the project I can see myself most focused on doing and would like to do the most.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My role in the project is a content planner. I need to extend every core function of the project, enrich our software, and make them more coordinated and consistent.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Sri Lanka and I came to Melbourne at the start of 2020. I have had an interest in computers ever since I was old enough to operate one. It still baffles me how such a small compact device can do so much. This interest led me to study and learn about Information Technology. During my school years I undertook and studied multiple IT courses as well. I have always been one to think about new inventions and systems that can make our lives easier and more efficient and I realized that this can be done through studying IT. That is my passion in IT. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>I would like to say I am proficient in looking at projects such as this from a third person view, which allows the final product to be exactly what it is expected to be. I also enjoy taking on a challenge and trying new things which I believe is necessary for growth. In terms of ability, I like to code HTML even though I am not the best at it</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My main responsibility in this project is to design the web page of our software. We introduce the functions of the application to users on a certain platform. The web page is the best choice.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p> was born in Australia whereas both my parents come from China. I can understand and speak both Chinese and English. I have little knowledge in the IT field however I do hope to learn and understand more about the IT industry. I also hope that I am able to understand IT in finer detail as it is always evolving and taking it to the next level.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>My strong point is that if I need to complete something, I would try to complete it as soon as possible to the best of my ability. If I ever have extra time, I would be willing to assist my group members if they would need assistance to complete some tasks. In this period of time writing this, I currently have interests in UX and UI design as I find that area of IT interesting and amusing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My main responsibility in the team is the verifier. I will test the prototype at each stage, find out the imperfections and mark it, and then contact my team members to modify it and make constructive suggestions to them.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I come from Hefei, a small city in central China. My hobby is to browse review videos and reports on various mobile phones and computers. Whenever a new product is released, I am very excited to compare their screens, processors, and various parameters. It is precisely because of this that I chose this course, or that I chose this major. I hope that the university courses can help me further understand the internal structure and software algorithms of these electronic products, and take it as my future Development goals, become a professional commentator, or join these technology companies.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>I have only learned the introductory knowledge about Java and some simple UI design. My interest may be more biased towards programming languages. I think the UI of a product is very important, but its core idea, what it can do/bring for users, is the most important. I think that in my next college career, I can learn more programming courses and get some practical opportunities, which will provide me a lot of help in teamwork and personal projects.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My main role in the team is to help design the UI interface, and to achieve zero error between each operation to ensure the smoothness of the application.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am currently studying in China due to the COVID-19. It's my second semester as an IT student. My passion in IT started in high school when my teacher introduced me to a programming language called Visual Basic. In the last semester, I have learned a new programming language--Java, which now I believe has become my strong point.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Interest and Skills</h3>
        <p>I have a very special feeling about programming languages. In the eyes of most people, they are a large number of boring numbers and letters, but in my opinion, they are like beautiful poems. Each piece of code reveals different emotions (functions), which makes me intoxicated.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Individually Assigned Role</h3>
        <p>My responsibilities are mainly responsible for processing the data. I need to ensure that when the software is running, we have a huge database to support our applications.
