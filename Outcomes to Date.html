            <h1> Overview </h1>
            <p>The outcomes we would like to achieve in our project is to create a brief/simple interactive design that is able to take in the user inputs and be processed within our application
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The outcomes we have achieved during the 12 week period is that we are able to process the user inputs through the application, ranging from search bars to text boxes that ask for the user input which ends up displaying what the user has requested.        
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Some outcomes that we were unable to achieve is creating our “functioning” design to be on the same platform as each individual have a different unique sets of skills that they are good at as some did their work on java whereas the others did the functioning designing using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This results in inconsistency whereby it should be fixed in the future if it we want it to release it in the future. To fix this outcome, we would need to have to design our functioning prototype in the same coding platform to achieve consistency between all our MVF designs.</p>
