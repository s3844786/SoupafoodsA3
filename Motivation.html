            <h1> Project Background </h1>
            <p>The project we are looking for should be practical and can be completed with our current knowledge and technology. The idea of managing your groceries seems to fulfill both of these requirements. Therefore we chose this project. Furthermore, we figured that this application can assist in solving day to day issues such as food wastage, money mismanagement and will help you to be more efficient when you go out to buy groceries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After the discussion we find that this app could actually help us in our own lives as most of the group members do their own grocery shopping and have resonated that they do have the problems that this application sets out to fix. This fact greatly motivated us to choose this project because we realized this application does have a lot of practical benefits. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The idea for this project seemed as if it could be done with our individual skills that we currently possess. It didn't seem too far fetched or technologically impossible. That being said, most of us are not exactly experienced so this app will give us the opportunity to go beyond what we know and can do. In terms of enriching our IT skills, this project gives opportunity for all types of IT skills ranging from coding to designing as both the back-end and front-end development of this app is extremely important.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The idea behind this project was born in Introduction to IT. The original application started off as a gadget that scans expiration dates which then deposits the date and the item name into a repository of items that was on a mobile app. After further thought and helpful feedback from the tutor, the group decided to change the whole idea from a connected gadget and app to a more fleshed out and feature packed standalone mobile application. This was done mainly because that it was understood based on the feedback we got that developing this app to work with another gadget seemed too complicated especially at that level. Therefore with the tutor's feedback in mind, the project idea was reformed. This version of that project is more in line with the idea we decided on for our project. This included many of the features that were going to be added to the original project.
